# Algorithim-analysis-project

## MVP

For our MVP of Project Parlay, we will be taking a static finite database from a sports league (ex: NFL, NHL, MLB, etc.) that contains the most important attributes needed to test our algorithm(s). These important attributes are: Games, Outcomes, Dates. From here will we be trying 4 different types of algorithms that we were suggested.

The finite database will allow us to test our algorithms on a small sample size to be scaled later on with live data using a web scraper.
