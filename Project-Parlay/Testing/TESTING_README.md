# Testing Section

Welcome to the testing section of our project repository. This document provides information on how to access the data visualizations and the most impactful takeaways from the testing research conducted on the project.

## Data Visualizations

To access the data visualizations from the testing, please refer to the file "SAMPtest_Analysis.ipynb". This file is located in the folder "Test_Results_Data_Analysis" in the project repository.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests that were conducted on the project, please use the following makefile: 

Project-Parlay/Testing/Testing_Files-AutoTest_Scripting/Makefile

This makefile includes commands for cleaning up previous test results and running the tests on the project. There are also commands for fetching the data from the test results.

To run the tests, simply navigate to the project directory in the command line and enter the command `make test` or `make testBF` to run the regular or brute-force tests respectively. The tests are structured to output raw data and csv files, which may be hard to understand. Please refer to the "data visualizations" section for how to interpert the testing data. 

## Conclusion

We hope this document provides a clear understanding of how to access the data visualizations and run the tests on the project. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.
